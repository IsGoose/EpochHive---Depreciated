*Epoch Hive Should only be used with DayZ Epoch*  

### Using prebuilt EpochHive
Copy: EpochHive.dll,MySql.Data.dll,Newtonsoft.Json.dll,BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll,Google.Protobuf.dll,Renci.SshNet.dll 
To your root Server Install Directory
Copy the hiveCfg.json file to your Server Config Directory and edit the config file to suit your needs and Database Login


### Using Source
After building EpochHive (see above), you will need to navigate to "...\bin\Debug\" and copy all DLL files to your root Server Install Directory.  
Next, create a new file in your Server Config Directory called "hiveCfg.json"  
Add the following JSON text to the file:
```json
{
	"Host": "localhost",
	"User": "root",
	"Password": "",
	"Schema": "dayz_epoch",
	"Instance": 11,
	"Time": "local",
	"Hour": 11,
	"LogLevel": "debug"
}
```  

This is EpochHive's Config File - the file that EpochHive will read from when it is called  
- Host: Host Address of the Database you are connecting to (localhost for local machine)
- User: Database User for EpochHive to connect with
- Password: Password of Database User
- Schema: Database Schema to read/write data (dayz_epoch is the default schema for epoch)
- Instance: InstanceID for you Server (11 is for Chernarus)
- Time: Time Setting. "local" for Local Server System Time, "static" for Static Time as defined below
- Hour: Hour to return if Time is set to "static" - not used if Time is set to "local"
- LogLevel: If "debug", then EpochHive will log every action. if left emtpy ("")  EpochHive will only log Critical Errors

EpochHive will log to a file called "EpochHiveLOG.txt" located in your root Server Install Directory
